# Hello! 👋

Welcome to my personal space on the internet. This is where I'll share:

## What you'll find here

- **Development tutorials**: Code, frameworks, best practices
- **Entrepreneurship experiences**: Learnings, failures, and successes
- **Growth hacking**: Strategies to grow products
- **Personal projects**: Things I'm working on

## Why a blog

In the era of social media, a blog is still the best place to:

1. **Deep dive into topics** - No character limit
2. **Own the content** - Don't depend on algorithms
3. **Improve my writing** - Constant practice
4. **Help others** - Document what I learn

## How it works

This blog is built with:

- **Next.js 15** - React framework
- **Markdown** - For writing posts
- **GitHub** - As CMS
- **Vercel** - For automatic deployment

Every time I push to GitHub, the blog updates automatically. Simple and effective.

## Let's stay in touch

If you want to stay updated with new posts, follow me on my social networks or visit the blog regularly.

See you in the next post!
